# myChessEngine

A Chess game and engine in Python. Based on this fantastic [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnYui0e73Rs&t=1980s).

Features:
* Possibility to play against human or AI. (At the moment this requires modifying flags in the code)
* Basic AI that uses minimax algorithm with alpha/beta pruning to choose the next move. The evaluation algorithms is based on material and piece position tables.
* A move log and possibility to undo a move (by pressing Z).
